At ViteConf 2022, StackBlitz launched [Codeflow Beta](https://stackblitz.com/codeflow/beta), a
development environment that runs natively in modern browsers. They entered a crowded market for
browser-based development environments. [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/),
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), and
[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) are the best-known players in this
space. They all have cloud-based products built with VS Code that aim to replace local development
environments.

If you wonder why you should replace your local development environment, I wrote a post that answers
this question:
[A better development workflow with disposable workspaces](/posts/a-better-development-workflow-with-disposable-workspaces).
In this post, I explain Gitpod's one-workspace-per-task philosophy.

For every new coding task, you fire up a disposable workspace with a new branch created or an
existing branch checked out and all dependencies installed. Once you have completed a task, you
dispose of the workspace. Codeflow also follows the one-workspace-per-task philosophy. But unlike
its cloud-based competitors, it is not a cloud-based offering.

## What is Codeflow?

Codeflow is VS Code running natively in
[supported browsers](https://developer.stackblitz.com/platform/webcontainers/browser-support), and
its enabling technology is called
[WebContainers](https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/introducing-webcontainers/). Think of
WebContainers as a small operating system that runs in a browser and can run Node.js version 16.
WebContainers run on [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), a cross-browser virtual machine that
many programming languages support as a compilation target.

If your project runs on Node.js, you can work on it with Codeflow. Gitpod, on the other hand,
supports any development environment that runs in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. But
I think the Node.js niche is big enough for StackBlitz to have a solid business case for Codeflow.

## Disposable workspaces

You can create a disposable workspace with the shortcut [pr.new](https://pr.new). For instance, to
write this post, I logged this issue on GitHub:

<Figure class="mb-8">

```
https://github.com/maiertech/maier.tech/issues/589
```

</Figure>

To fire up a Codeflow workspace for this issue, I prepended the URL with **pr.new** and launched the
prepended URL in my browser:

<Figure class="mb-8">

```
https://pr.new/github.com/maiertech/maier.tech/issues/589
```

</Figure>

Codeflow fired up a workspace in my browser on branch `maiertech/issue589` and installed all
dependencies.

Prepending URLs with **pr.new** also works for GitHub pull request and branch URLs. The workspace
will have the existing branches checked out in these two scenarios.

## GitHub integration

Codeflow comes with a
[GitHub integration](https://developer.stackblitz.com/codeflow/integrating-codeflowapp-bot) called
codeflowapp, which comments on every pull request. It makes manually prepending GitHub URLs with
**pr.new** obsolete because it adds a link to launch a Codeflow workspace as a pull request comment:

## VS Code extensions

Extensions are indispensable for my developer happiness when I work with VS Code. For instance, I
use the [Prettier](https://open-vsx.org/extension/esbenp/prettier-vscode) extension in every
project. When I work with Svelte, I use
[Svelte for VS Code](https://open-vsx.org/extension/svelte/svelte-vscode).

Supporting VS Code extensions in browser-based workspaces is a challenge. Due to licensing
restrictions, these workspaces run with [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), VS Code's open-source
core. But VSCodium ships without support for
[Microsoft's marketplace for VS Code extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode).
Codeflow's cloud-based competitors came up with two approaches to support VS Code extensions:

1. Running a cloud workspace in a local VS Code provides access to Microsoft's extension marketplace
   without a workaround.
2. Gitpod created an alternative marketplace called [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/).
   Gitpod's browser-based workspaces install VS Code extensions from the alternative marketplace.

Codeflow comes with a selection of popular extensions pre-installed. Launching a workspace will
enable project-specific extensions listed in `.vscode/extensions.json`. If an extension is not
available in Codeflow, you will see a warning:

<Figure caption="You are out of luck when a project requires extensions not pre-installed in Codeflow." class="mb-8">
	<UnsupportedExtensionsImage />
</Figure>

## Settings sync

Codeflow supports settings sync for VS Code user settings. You can customize a workspace with user
settings, and Codeflow will apply these settings to every workspace it launches. Note that Codeflow
has a custom synchronization provider, i.e., it cannot sync with the settings you already have in
your local VS Code (which syncs with a GitHub or Microsoft account).

## Package managers

When you run NPM in a Codeflow workspace, you run StackBlitz's
[Turbo](https://developer.stackblitz.com/platform/webcontainers/turbo-package-manager#frontmatter-title)
package manager (not to be confused with [Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack) and
[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)). Turbo supports only a subset of NPM commands, e.g., it does
not support `npm outdated`. According to StackBlitz, Codeflow will eventually support the full NPM
CLI. Until then, Codeflow fully supports NPM alternatives [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). And
[Turborepo](https://github.com/stackblitz/core/issues/1814#issuecomment-1374835721) if you work with
a monorepo.

## Codeflow Beta caveats

Codeflow is in beta; therefore, you should expect bugs and rough edges:

- The [FAQ](https://developer.stackblitz.com/codeflow/codeflow-faq) states that the code does not
  persist between sessions, and you will lose your code if you reload or close the browser tab. To
  prevent this, commit and push to the origin often.
- During my tests with Codeflow, I encountered various bugs, e.g., the Prettier extension would not
  work, Codeflow would not apply my user settings, or Codeflow would not recognize the GitHub
  repository it just cloned.
- It is impossible to store secrets as environment variables. If you need a secret, such as an API
  key, you must rely on `.env` files during development.

## Conclusion

Codeflow Beta is a significant milestone towards disposable workspaces that run natively in
browsers. But it has several drawbacks, e.g., limited VS Code extensions and support for Node
projects only.

If you already use one of Codeflow's competitors and it works for you, it is hard to argue why you
should trade in something battle-tested for a bleeding-edge workspace with fewer features. I see the
appeal of using WebContainers to run a development environment. But StackBlitz has yet to find
convincing use cases where Codeflow outperforms its cloud competitors. Keep an eye on Codeflow and
take it for a spin once it is out of beta.
