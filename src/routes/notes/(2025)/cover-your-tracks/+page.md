The [EFF](https://www.eff.org/) has a website to check whether your browser protects you from being
tracked through fingerprinting. Fingerprinting is a tracking technique that collects unique details
about your device and browser settings to create a profile that identifies you across websites
without using cookies.

On the Cover Your Tracks website, you can test if your browser does enough to protect you from being
fingerprinted. I was surprised to see that Safari handles this much better than Chromium. In my
case, I tested a de-Googled Helium browser with [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/).

Helium users are vulnerable to being fingerprinted:

Safari, on the other hand, protects users with a randomized fingerprint:

On macOS, Safari is the better choice for everyday browsing.
