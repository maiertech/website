  'Why long, multi-step AI agent workflows often fail: compounding errors, rising token costs, and
  fragile tool integrations.'

In this post, Utkarsh Kanwat put my perception about multi-step AI workflows into words. While AI is
part of my coding workflow, I've been struggling with multi-step, agentic workflows. For one-step
coding tasks I get good results with models like Claude Sonnet 4.5 or Haiku 4.5, but for anything
more complex that requires multiple steps, the perceived value I get from AI degrades quickly.

Utkarsh weighs in on the hype around multi-step AI agents. He argues that:

- error rates compound across multi-step workflows, so long chains become unreliable;
- conversational context windows create quadratic token costs, making long interactions economically
  unsustainable; and
- agent tools and integrations are hard to engineer because they often require human confirmation
  gates.
