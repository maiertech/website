I have watched quite a few interviews with [Rich Harris](https://bsky.app/profile/rich-harris.dev)
over the years. Every single one has been either insightful or entertaining, or both. It's
fascinating how he combines exceptional engineering talent with a personable and sympathetic way of
talking about Svelte and its community:

> "One of the nice things about the Svelte community is that it is largely populated with people who
> have chosen to be there."

Even though this is the umpteenth interview with Rich Harris, I found myself enjoying it
nonetheless.
