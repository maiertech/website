Great article by Chris Nicholas on how to write exceptional documentation. He recommends the
following sections:

- _Quickstart_ - Minimal steps to get started.
- _Tutorials_ - Learning-focused guides that teach usage.
- _How-to Guides_ - Problem-solving instructions.
- _Explanations_ - Concepts and underlying theory.
- _Examples/Templates_ - Working code samples and starter projects.

He dives into each section and provides many examples of documentation that nail these sections.
