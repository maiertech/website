This post asks a tough question: am I still relevant as a (senior) developer as AI is being
integrated into every step of development workflows?

I can't wait to dump all my daily chores on AI. Chores need to get done, but it's fine if AI does
them and I do a review. Even for harder problems, AI can explore the solution space for me. When
it's time to hand over, I am fresh and motivated because I did not have to spend the last three
hours on energy-draining chores. I will have energy left to craft a kick-ass PR that communicates
clearly to my team what I did and how they can review it in no time.

AI creates room for my team and me to step up our communication game. We morph from a bunch of code
plumbers to workflow enablers who can ship faster without compromising on code quality.

I might be a little too optimistic, though. It will be very tempting for organizations to use AI as
an excuse to move forward with fewer code plumbers.

The GitHub blog post that triggered this question describes in more detail the parts of the
development workflow where developers should step up their communication game to stay relevant.
